### Services 

- Over 30 services covered in the course


### AWS Global infrastructure 

- Regions, AZ, Data centers and Edge locations / Points of Presence
- Region = cluster of Data centers
  - Most AWS Services are region scoped
  - How to choose a Region : Compliance, Proximity (reduce latency), Available services and Pricing 
- Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 3, max is 6)
  - Example for Region Sydney (ap-southeast-2) : ap-southeast-2a, ap-southeast-2b, ap-southeast-2c
  - Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
  - They're separate from each other, so that they're isolated from disasters 
  - They're connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
